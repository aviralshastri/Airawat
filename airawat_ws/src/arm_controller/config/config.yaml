# ============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 
# 1. All angles are in DEGREES (not radians)
# 2. Array order must match joint_names order
# 3. Each state executes in sequence:
#    - Smooth trajectory from current position to target angles
#    - Wait for specified delay
#    - Move to next state
# 
# 4. Delays between states allow for:
#    - Material settling
#    - Mechanical stabilization
#    - Visual inspection
# 
# 5. Set delay to 0.0 for the last state in each sequence
# 
# 6. To modify behavior:
#    - Add more states by incrementing state number (state_5, state_6, etc.)
#    - Adjust angles for your specific arm geometry
#    - Change durations for faster/slower movements
#    - Modify delays for operation timing
#
