    # DUMP STATE SEQUENCE
    # ========================================================================
    # Sequence for dumping material
    dump_states:
      state_1:
        angles: [0.0, 50.0]          # Move to dump position

        delay: 0.0

# ============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 
# 1. All angles are in DEGREES (not radians)
# 
# 2. Startup Sequence:
#    - Node starts with joints at [0.0, 0.0]
#    - Automatically moves to init_angles over init_angle_duration
#    - Then waits for service commands
# 
# 3. Array order must match joint_names order:
#    - joint_names: ["wrist", "shoulder"]
#    - angles: [wrist_angle, shoulder_angle]
# 
# 4. Each state executes in sequence:
#    - Smooth trajectory from current position to target angles
#    - Wait for specified delay
#    - Move to next state
# 
# 5. Delays between states allow for:
#    - Material settling
#    - Mechanical stabilization
#    - Visual inspection
# 
# 6. Set delay to 0.0 for the last state in each sequence
# 
# 7. Command Interruption:
#    - Any new command interrupts current operation immediately
#    - Emergency stop freezes at current position
#    - Single joint commands stop state sequences
# 
# 8. To modify behavior:
#    - Add more states by incrementing state number (state_5, state_6, etc.)
#    - Adjust angles for your specific arm geometry
#    - Change durations for faster/slower movements
#    - Modify delays for operation timing
